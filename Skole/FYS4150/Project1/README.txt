All C++ compiled on Linux using g++.

No dependencies between problems except 2 and 7.

Not all data are included in .txt files, it only saves as strings, which makes the files too big to be pushed to github. Therefore a selection of up to 5000 points have been made.

Most code has some comments, but much of the code is reused from problem to problem, and it follows the algorithms discussed in the main pdf.

Running the code should not depend on the system its ran on, although the timing tests might vary. The results included comes from running on a dated system.
